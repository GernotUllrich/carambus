  - Automatically converts during `prepare_development`
  - Creates schema-compatible backup before migration
  - Documented in scenario_management.en.md

- **Simplified Table Client Setup** (`bin/setup-table-raspi.sh`)
  - Only 3 parameters needed: scenario, current_ip, table_name
  - Club WLAN from `config.yml` (production.network.club_wlan)
  - Dev WLAN from `~/.carambus_config` (CARAMBUS_DEV_WLAN_*)
  - Static IP automatically from Database (table_locals.ip_address)
  - Multi-WLAN with automatic fallback

- **Database Analysis Tool** (`bin/check-database-states.sh`)
  - Comprehensive analysis of database states across Local, Production and API Server
  - Compares version IDs, table_locals and tournament_locals
  - Warns about unbumped IDs (< 50,000,000)
  - Shows ID ranges and local data statistics
  - Usage: `./bin/check-database-states.sh <scenario_name>`

- **Puma Service Wrapper** (`bin/puma-wrapper.sh`)
