# The developer about himself:

*Uncompromising automation of billiards game operations, from tournament planning and data collection to the transmission of game results. That is the goal of the Carambus project.*

*Actually, my consulting business Ullrich-IT-Consulting is already history, as I have been retired for quite some time. But on the occasion of th anniversary of my club [Billardclub Wedel 61 e.V.](http://www.billardclub-wedel.de/), I finally came up with the idea of contributing something substantial.*

*And anyone who knows me knows that throughout my professional life – most recently as a member of the visionary circle at Sun Microsystems – I have always been keen to use the latest technologies.*

*And first came into contact with the Ruby/Rails development environment in 2008. Since then, I have appreciated the enormous progress made in development speed. The big question now was whether this project, which in many places places real-time demands on the display and recording systems involved, could be meaningfully realized with RoR.*


*The project was therefore preceded by an approximately four-week evaluation of possible development environments – in particular React, React Native, and Angular. Unfortunately, this led to very complex breakpoints between server-side database-oriented logic and JavaScript-based end devices. In other words, different operating systems, languages, and frameworks. Not a good idea. Fortunately, I came across an ideal solution via [GoRails](https://gorails.com) – Stimulus Reflex and Cable Ready! Carambus is a server-based web solution with a single-page feel and scoreboards!*

*Starting in 2024, AI support with tools such as Cursor, LLM models from Anthropic, and OpenAi brought a whole new dimension to software development.  It turned out that the structure of the Ruby and Rails environment, based on well-defined standards, was excellently suited to being understood by AI. This made it very easy to make complex enhancements to the system and documentation that I would never have tackled otherwise due to lack of time.*
