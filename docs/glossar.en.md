## üñ•Ô∏è Server Architecture

### ClubCloud
**[ClubCloud](https://club-cloud.de/)** is a web-based management software for sports associations and clubs.

**Important:** ClubCloud is **NOT** Carambus!

**What is ClubCloud?**
- External management software for associations
- 14 of 17 German billard associations use it
- Each association has its own ClubCloud instance (e.g., ndbv.de, westfalenbillard.net)
- Manages: Players, Clubs, Tournaments, Leagues, Rankings

**Relationship to Carambus:**
- Carambus **scrapes** data from ClubCloud (daily at 4:00 AM)
- Carambus is **independent** and works without ClubCloud
- Results can be exported back to ClubCloud via CSV

**See:** [ClubCloud Integration](clubcloud_integration.en.md) for scraping process details

---

### API Server (Central Server)
The **API Server** is the central data source for all Carambus installations.

**Main tasks:**
- **Scraping:** Loads data from ClubCloud and other external sources
- **Central data storage:** Stores **all** data from **all** regions
- **Synchronization:** Distributes data to Local Servers (filtered by region)

**Example:** carambus.de

**Data source:** Scraping from ClubCloud instances (see [ClubCloud Integration](clubcloud_integration.en.md))

### Local Server (Regional/Club Server)
A **Local Server** is a Carambus installation for a specific location.

**Main tasks:**
- **Local game management:** Tournaments, scoreboards, match days
- **Regional data:** Only data from own region (filtered from API Server)
- **Offline capability:** Can work independently from API Server

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Offline-capable (important for match days!)
- ‚úÖ Fast scoreboards (no internet needed)
- ‚úÖ Smaller database (only own region)

**Example:** Raspberry Pi in BC Hamburg club house

### Local Data (Locally Created Data)
**Local Data** is data created on a Local Server (not from scraping).

**Simply put:** Everything the club creates and manages itself, without being recorded in the supra-regional ClubCloud.

**ID Ranges:**
- IDs **< 50,000,000:** Scraped from API Server (from ClubCloud)
- IDs **‚â• 50,000,000:** Local Data (created locally at club)

**Practical examples:**
- üèÜ Club tournament (year-end tournament, not in ClubCloud)
- üéØ Training games (Tuesday training for performance tracking)
- üë• Guest players (visitors without club membership)
- üìÖ Table reservation (with heating control)
- üèÖ Internal club championship (over multiple weeks)

**Why important:**
- ‚úÖ Offline-capable (no internet needed)
- ‚úÖ No ID conflicts
- ‚úÖ Club has full control
- ‚úÖ Statistics for training
- ‚úÖ LocalProtector prevents accidental overwrites

**Example:**
```
Scraped tournament:  ID 12,345 (ClubCloud, official)
Club tournament:     ID 50,001,234 (club only)
Training game:       ID 50,100,567 (Tuesday training)
```
