        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Automation of billiards game operations without compromize from tournament scheduling to data collection and transfer of game results. That is the goal of the Carambus project.</p>
        <p>Actually my consulting business Ullrich-IT-Consulting is already history, because I am retired since a long time.
        But on the occasion of a forthcoming major anniversary of my carambol club <a href=http://www.billardclub-wedel.de>Billardclub Wedel 61 e.V.</a> the idea came to me
        to make a substantial contribution.</p>
        <p>And anybody knowing me, knows that during my whole professional life - last as a visionary at Sun Microsystems - I was eager to discover and apply the newest technologies available.</p>
        <p>I first came into contact with the Ruby/Rails development environment 12 years ago. Since then I appreciate the enormous progress
        in development speed. The big question now was whether this project, which has in many places
        real-time requirements on the display and acquisition system involved, could be sensibly realized with RoR.<p>
        <p>So the project was first preceded by about 4 weeks of evaluation of possible development environments - especially React, React Native and Angular.
        Unfortunately, this would have lead in each case to very costly discontinuities between server-side database-oriented logic and the JavaScript-based endpoints with
        different operating systems, languages, and frameworks. Not a good idea.
        Fortunately
        I came across <a href=\"http://gorails.com\">GoRails</a> for an ideal solution - Stimulus Reflex and Cable Ready!  Carambus is a server-based web solution with a single page feeling!
        </p>
