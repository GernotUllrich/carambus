<h1 class='font-bold text-xl mt-4'>The developer about himself:</h1><p class='text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 leading-relaxed my-4'>*Uncompromising automation of billiard game operations from tournament planning to data acquisition and transmission of game results. That is the goal of the Carambus project</p><p class='text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 leading-relaxed my-4'><em>Actually, my consulting business Ullrich-IT-Consulting is already history, as I have been retired for some time now. But on the occasion of the upcoming anniversary of my club <a href="http://www.billardclub-wedel.de/">Billardclub Wedel 61 e.V.</a>, I finally had the idea of contributing something substantial.</em></p><p class='text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 leading-relaxed my-4'><em>And anyone who knows me knows that throughout my entire professional life - most recently as a visionary at Sun Microsystems - I have been keen to use the latest technologies</em></p><p class='text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 leading-relaxed my-4'><em>i first came into contact with the Ruby/Rails development environment in 2008. Since then, I have appreciated the enormous progress in development speed. The big question now was whether this project, which places real-time requirements on the display and acquisition systems involved in many places, could be realized with RoR in a meaningful way.</em></p><p class='text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 leading-relaxed my-4'>*The project was therefore initially preceded by an approx. 4-week evaluation of possible development environments - in particular React, React Native and Angular. Unfortunately, this led to very complex breakpoints between server-side database-oriented logic and the JavaScript-based end devices. In other words, different operating systems, languages and frameworks. Not a good idea. Fortunately, I found an ideal solution via <a href="https://gorails.com">GoRails</a> - Stimulus Reflex and Cable Ready! Carambus is a server-based web solution with a single page feeling and the scoreboards!</p><p class='text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 leading-relaxed my-4'><em>Dr. Gernot Ullrich</em></p><p class='text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 leading-relaxed my-4'><em>Ullrich-IT-Consulting</em></p>
