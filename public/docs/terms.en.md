## Text to Translate:

This web application essentially has two interfaces:
- Tournament schedules and results from the website billardarea.de (BA), or since 2022 from the various regional ClubCloud instances.
- The display boards at the tables.

After the tournament data and seeding lists have been retrieved from the ClubCloud, Carambus works independently, with the chosen tournament mode being synchronized with the display boards. Without further intervention by the tournament manager, the tournament process is controlled and executed according to the chosen tournament mode through inputs on the display boards.

For security reasons (no warranty here! ;-) ), the tournament management should not rely solely on the inputs at the display boards. A parallel recording of the game results on the prescribed game protocol forms should be carried out manually.
