## Key Observations

1. **Season-based Changes**: Many of these differences appear to be related to different seasons, suggesting that shortname conventions may have changed over time.

2. **Discipline-based Differences**: Some leagues with the same name have different shortnames based on the discipline (Pool vs Karambol vs Snooker).

3. **Naming Convention Evolution**: The shortnames seem to have evolved from longer, more descriptive formats to shorter, more standardized ones.

4. **Regional Variations**: Different regions appear to have different approaches to shortname conventions.

## Recommendations

1. **Standardize Shortnames**: Consider implementing a consistent shortname convention across all regions and seasons.

2. **Data Migration**: For historical data, consider whether to update old shortnames to match current conventions.

3. **Validation Rules**: Implement validation to prevent future inconsistencies in shortname assignments.

4. **Documentation**: Create clear guidelines for shortname assignment to ensure consistency going forward.

## Technical Details

The analysis was performed using a Ruby script that:
- Queries all regions that organize leagues
- Groups leagues by name within each region
- Identifies groups with multiple leagues
- Checks for different shortnames within each group
- Provides detailed information about each duplicate found

This helps identify potential data quality issues and inconsistencies in the league management system.
