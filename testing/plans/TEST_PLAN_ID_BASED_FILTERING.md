# üß™ Test Plan: ID-Based Filtering System

## Overview
Test the ID-based exact matching system for region and club selectors to ensure it properly handles spaces in names and provides exact matches instead of text-based `ilike` queries.

## Test Environment
- **Rails Server**: Running on port 3000
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with local data
- **Models**: Player, Club, Location with region_id and club_id fields

## Test Cases

### 1. **Player Page Filtering** ‚úÖ
**URL**: `http://localhost:3000/players`

#### Test 1.1: Region Filter with ID-Based Matching
- [ ] Open Players page
- [ ] Click filter icon (funnel)
- [ ] Select a region from dropdown (e.g., "BBBV" or "BB BV")
- [ ] Apply filter
- [ ] **Expected**: Search uses `region_id:2` instead of `region_shortname:BBBV`
- [ ] **Verify**: Results show only players from that exact region

#### Test 1.2: Club Filter with ID-Based Matching
- [ ] Open Players page
- [ ] Click filter icon
- [ ] Select a club from dropdown
- [ ] Apply filter
- [ ] **Expected**: Search uses `club_id:123` instead of `club_shortname:ClubName`
- [ ] **Verify**: Results show only players from that exact club

#### Test 1.3: Cascading Region ‚Üí Club Filter
- [ ] Open Players page
- [ ] Click filter icon
- [ ] Select region first
- [ ] **Expected**: Club dropdown updates to show only clubs from that region
- [ ] Select club from filtered list
- [ ] Apply filter
- [ ] **Verify**: Both region_id and club_id are used in search

### 2. **Club Page Filtering** ‚úÖ
**URL**: `http://localhost:3000/clubs`

#### Test 2.1: Region Filter with ID-Based Matching
- [ ] Open Clubs page
- [ ] Click filter icon
- [ ] Select a region from dropdown
- [ ] Apply filter
- [ ] **Expected**: Search uses `region_id:X` instead of `region_shortname:RegionName`
- [ ] **Verify**: Results show only clubs from that exact region

#### Test 2.2: Cascading Region ‚Üí Club Filter
- [ ] Open Clubs page
- [ ] Click filter icon
- [ ] Select region first
- [ ] **Expected**: Club dropdown updates to show only clubs from that region
- [ ] **Verify**: Dynamic filtering works correctly

### 3. **Location Page Filtering** ‚úÖ
**URL**: `http://localhost:3000/locations`

#### Test 3.1: Region Filter with ID-Based Matching
- [ ] Open Locations page
- [ ] Click filter icon
- [ ] Select a region from dropdown
- [ ] Apply filter
- [ ] **Expected**: Search uses `region_id:X` instead of `region_shortname:RegionName`
- [ ] **Verify**: Results show only locations from clubs in that region

#### Test 3.2: Club Filter with ID-Based Matching
- [ ] Open Locations page
- [ ] Click filter icon
- [ ] Select a club from dropdown
- [ ] Apply filter
- [ ] **Expected**: Search uses `club_id:X` instead of `club_shortname:ClubName`
- [ ] **Verify**: Results show only locations from that exact club

#### Test 3.3: Cascading Region ‚Üí Club Filter
- [ ] Open Locations page
- [ ] Click filter icon
- [ ] Select region first
- [ ] **Expected**: Club dropdown updates to show only clubs from that region
- [ ] Select club from filtered list
- [ ] Apply filter
- [ ] **Verify**: Both region_id and club_id are used in search

## Technical Verification

### 4. **JavaScript Console Verification**
- [ ] Open browser developer tools
- [ ] Navigate to Console tab
- [ ] Apply a region or club filter
- [ ] **Expected**: Console shows `"Applying filters"` message
- [ ] **Expected**: Search string contains `region_id:` or `club_id:` instead of text-based fields

### 5. **Network Tab Verification**
- [ ] Open browser developer tools
- [ ] Navigate to Network tab
- [ ] Apply a filter
- [ ] **Expected**: Request URL contains ID-based parameters
- [ ] **Verify**: No `ilike` queries for reference fields

### 6. **Database Query Verification**
- [ ] Check Rails logs during filter application
- [ ] **Expected**: SQL queries use `WHERE regions.id = ?` or `WHERE clubs.id = ?`
- [ ] **Verify**: No `WHERE regions.shortname ILIKE ?` for reference fields

## Edge Cases

### 7. **Space Handling in Names**
- [ ] Test with region names containing spaces (e.g., "BB BV")
- [ ] **Expected**: ID-based matching works regardless of spaces
- [ ] **Verify**: No issues with space characters in names

### 8. **Special Characters**
- [ ] Test with region/club names containing special characters
- [ ] **Expected**: ID-based matching works regardless of special characters
- [ ] **Verify**: No issues with special characters

### 9. **Empty Selections**
- [ ] Test applying filters with no selections
- [ ] **Expected**: No errors, empty search string
- [ ] **Verify**: System handles empty selections gracefully

## Performance Tests

### 10. **Large Dataset Performance**
- [ ] Test with large number of regions/clubs
- [ ] **Expected**: Filter dropdowns load quickly
- [ ] **Verify**: No performance degradation with large datasets

### 11. **Concurrent Filtering**
- [ ] Test multiple filter applications in quick succession
- [ ] **Expected**: No race conditions or errors
- [ ] **Verify**: System handles rapid filter changes

## Browser Compatibility

### 12. **Cross-Browser Testing**
- [ ] Test in Chrome
- [ ] Test in Firefox
- [ ] Test in Safari
- [ ] **Expected**: Consistent behavior across browsers
- [ ] **Verify**: No browser-specific issues

## Mobile Testing

### 13. **Mobile Responsiveness**
- [ ] Test on mobile device or mobile browser emulation
- [ ] **Expected**: Filter popup works correctly on mobile
- [ ] **Verify**: Touch interactions work properly
